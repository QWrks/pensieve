# Q-Cat: Categorical Operant Subjectivity {#q-cat}

## Abstract

Q-Sorts record item positions *continuously*, distending from a neutral mid-point along some dimension. 
However, while adhering to Stephenson's ontology and epistemology, Q methodology can also be extended to cover *categorical* operant subjectivity.

We here suggest a survey method and analytical algorithm to capture such shared viewpoints of categorizing items.
The well-established [Repertory Grid Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repertory_grid) also shares some of Q's underpinnings and allows spontaneous categories, but does not lend itself (easily) to a transposed, "Q-wise" factor extraction and may not be ipsative between the items. 
Instead, we invite participants to come up with their own, dichotomous categories and ask them to classify the full Q-Set accordingly.
The resultant logical table is summarized into a per-person measure of categorical item similarity, in turn transformed into a person-by-person correlation matrix.
We then extract higher-level principal components (PCA) in a stepwise residual process, and calculate the respective (rotated) component scores, yielding ideal-typical, shared ways of categorizing the Q-Set.
These categorical viewpoints are then subjected to a nested, low-level PCA to allow a substantive abduction of just *what* those categories might be.

Using real-world data gathered for this purpose, we show that results from the suggested procedure can be meaningfully interpreted as categorical operant subjectivity.
We also present software for the R statistics framework to run the analysis.

Categorizing things can be considered a fundamental, spontaneous act of the human mind, and Q-Cat is a helpful addition to the Q-methodologists toolkit to study it.
