## Abstract

Q-Sorts record item positions *continuously*, distending from a neutral mid-point along some dimension. 
However, while adhering to Stephenson's ontology and epistemology, Q methodology can also be extended to cover *categorical* operant subjectivity.

We here suggest a survey method and analytical algorithm to capture such shared viewpoints of categorizing items.
The well-established [Repertory Grid Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repertory_grid) also shares some of Q's underpinnings and allows spontaneous categories, but does not lend itself (easily) to a transposed, "Q-wise" factor extraction and may not be ipsative between the items. 
Instead, we invite participants to come up with their own, dichotomous categories and ask them to classify the full Q-Set accordingly.
The resultant logical table is summarized into a per-person measure of categorical item similarity, in turn transformed into a person-by-person correlation matrix.
We then extract higher-level principal components (PCA) in a stepwise residual process, and calculate the respective (rotated) component scores, yielding ideal-typical, shared ways of categorizing the Q-Set.
These categorical viewpoints are then subjected to a nested, low-level PCA to allow a substantive abduction of just *what* those categories might be.

Using real-world data gathered for this purpose, we show that results from the suggested procedure can be meaningfully interpreted as categorical operant subjectivity.
We also present software for the R statistics framework to run the analysis.

Categorizing things can be considered a fundamental, spontaneous act of the human mind, and Q-Cat is a helpful addition to the Q-methodologists toolkit to study it.

```{r kill-nas, echo=FALSE}
data(komki)

# kill nas
komki$qsorts <- na.omit(komki$qsorts)
komki$items <- komki$items[komki$items$Handle.english %in% rownames(komki$qsorts), ]
komki$qcat$ass <- sapply(X = komki$qcat$ass, simplify = FALSE, FUN = function(x) {
  x[rownames(x) %in% rownames(komki$qsorts), , drop = FALSE]
})

# killing jason, because a) he just didn't REALLY do the thing and b) he dominates the qcat model, which we don't like.
komki$qsorts <- komki$qsorts[, colnames(komki$qsorts) != "Jason"]
komki$qcat$desc <- komki$qcat$desc[, colnames(komki$qcat$desc) != "Jason"]
komki$qcat$ass$Jason <- NULL
```


## Data Gathering: Subjective Categorizing as *Pure Behavior*

In the `Q-Cat` procedure, participants sort items according to their own, "first-person", arbitrary categories.
<!-- TODO add citation for first-person -->
These categories are:

- **operant**, because they arise *spontaneously* as participants engage the items,
- **inductive**, because participants describe their own, *open-ended* categories, which can be neither correct, nor incorrect,
- **ipsatively** assigned, because categories are originally defined as *similarity* between categories.

In contrast to other sorting techniques, which require a *single* set of mutually exclusive, and comprehensively exhaustive ("MECE") categories as a disjoint set vis-a-vis the items [@coxon-1999, p. 3], `Q-Cat` *encourages* overlapping *multiple* categories, each of which is merely *logically* (`TRUE`, `FALSE`) assigned to each item.
This complicates the analysis, but avoids imposing a pre-supposed structure of categorical subjectivity on participants.
^[In a future iteration, participants will ipsatively *rank* items vis-a-vis a categorical *prototype* (chosen from the items, compare @rosch-1978), yielding *ordinal* information, requiring a separate, non-parametric analytical procedure.]

For our example study on categorizations of language games with children and grown-ups, this yields a *list* of description matrices (one element for each participant, as in table \@ref(tab:desc-example)) and a three-dimensional *array* of assignment matrices (one slice for each participant, as in table \@ref(tab:ass-example)).
^[This canonical data representation can be easily produced from conveniently entered raw data with [`pensieveR::import_qcat()`](http://pensiever.maxheld.de).]

                          eating_grandpa = komki$qcat$ass$Julius["eating-grandpa", which(x = LETTERS %in% names(chosen_cats))])

kable(x = desc_example,

## Interpretation

While different in procedure and data type, `Q-Cat` shares the paradigmatic foundations of Q methodology.
As Watts writes about Q-*Sorts*, here *too*:

> It does not reflect any inner experience and it has little in common with concepts like mind and consciousness."

<!-- "Operational definitions begin with concepts in search of behavior; operant definitions begin with behavior in search of concepts." [@Brown-1980, p. 28] -->

<!-- This is an extension of the scientific study of human subjectivity. -->

<!-- this is not about mental representation as from psych, but -->

<!-- -a viewpoint is relational: an interaction between subject and world (an object, another person, an event, a concept ... ) -->
<!-- -viewpoints are the act of observation -->
<!-- -viewpoints are inherently meaningful -->
