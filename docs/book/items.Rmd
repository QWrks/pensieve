# Items

Good, evocative items lie at the heart of a Q study.
In fact, akin to the old computer science adage of  *"garbage-in / garbage-out"*, the quality of the *items* strictly limits the insights that may be gleaned from the entire study.

Generating and selecting good items is at least half science, half tradecraft.
There are some standards and frameworks that can structure your item generation and sampling, but -- for now at least -- it still requires a lot of experience, intuition and knowledge of the domain in question.

`pensieve` supports this stage of a Q study in a number of ways:

1. Items **generation and selection** can be fully documented inside of `pensieve`, making the process transparent, reproducible and easy to iterate over.
2. Items can be **professionally typeset**, and stored in `pensieve`, so that Q sorters and researchers alike both see the items in the *same, definitive form*, be they text or images.
3. Arbitrary **additional information** can be stored alongside the items for later "R-way" analysis.


Items and related information are stored in a specific, domain-specific format in `pensieve`, a list of S3 class `QItems`.
The `QItems` list *can* be quite extensive, covering all *possible* use cases.
But there is no need to worry, if your study is simpler: most of its elements are optional, and it is easy to get your items in and out of it.

- `QItems`
  - `QItemConcourse` (char or bin matrix)
  - `QItemFeatures` (tibble)
  - `QItemStrata` (array)
  - `QItemSample` (char vector)
  - `QItemFormat` (list)
  - `QItemSet` (list)
