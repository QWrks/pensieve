I want a simple histogram with density polygon on top, and, crucially *density* (not counts) as the y axis.

This is what you'd expect:

```{r repro density}
df.stdn <- data.frame(values = rnorm(1000))
g <- ggplot(data = df.stdn, mapping = aes(x = values))
g <- g + geom_histogram(mapping = aes(y = ..density..))
g <- g + geom_density()
g  # looking ok
plot(density(df.stdn[,1]))  # looking about the same
```

Now, consider what happens when you have very small values:

```{r repro small}
df.small <- data.frame(values = rnorm(1000)/1000)
g <- ggplot(data = df.small, mapping = aes(x = values))
g <- g + geom_histogram(mapping = aes(y = ..scaled..))
g <- g + geom_density()
g + stat_function(fun = dt, colour = "red", args = list(df = 36-1, n=))
help(dt)
# looking very strange, with densities > 1
plot(density(df.small[,1]))  # looking about the same
```
