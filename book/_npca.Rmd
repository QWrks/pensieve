<!-- great argument from stephenson against latent variable model in factor analysis can be found where he rails against R methodology (this is from Watts Stenner 11): -->
<!-- > it (the R methodological factor) only considered "measuring any individual for those differences which enter onto a factor" (Stephenson 1936b: 205) -->

<!-- in watts stenner 14: -->
<!-- > "There are, he says, 'possibly millions of *types*', which Q methodological factors might capture, 'common that is to several or many persons, but not necessarily to all' (Stephenson 1963b: 209). The non-universitylita of these types would ensure, in marked contrast to the R technique, that the factors obtained 'in correlating persons ... will be numerous and broad' (Burt and Stephenson, 1939: 274)." -->
<!-- This seems pretty much impossible, unlikely, at least with limited number sof factors -->
<!-- also consider whether R and Q are in PCA not exactly the same, just with loas and scores exchanged; perhaps all that Q PCA does differently, is to rotate on the people-loas, instead of the item scores; one might, however, wonder, whether we should not also rotate on the item-scores. Perhaps, indeed, rotating on the item-scores, and whether that makes a difference vis a vis rotating on the loas could be a finding in itself. Rotating on the scores would mean, for example, that we would want some items to be at the poles. -->
