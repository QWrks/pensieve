## Abstract

Q-Sorts record item positions *continuously*, distending from a neutral mid-point along some dimension. 
However, while adhering to Stephenson's ontology and epistemology, Q methodology can also be extended to cover *categorical* operant subjectivity.

We here suggest a survey method and analytical algorithm to capture such shared viewpoints of categorizing items.
The well-established [Repertory Grid Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repertory_grid) also shares some of Q's underpinnings and allows spontaneous categories, but does not lend itself (easily) to a transposed, "Q-wise" factor extraction and may not be ipsative between the items. 
Instead, we invite participants to come up with their own, dichotomous categories and ask them to classify the full Q-Set accordingly.
The resultant logical table is summarized into a per-person measure of categorical item similarity, in turn transformed into a person-by-person correlation matrix.
We then extract higher-level principal components (PCA) in a stepwise residual process, and calculate the respective (rotated) component scores, yielding ideal-typical, shared ways of categorizing the Q-Set.
These categorical viewpoints are then subjected to a nested, low-level PCA to allow a substantive abduction of just *what* those categories might be.

Using real-world data gathered for this purpose, we show that results from the suggested procedure can be meaningfully interpreted as categorical operant subjectivity.
We also present software for the R statistics framework to run the analysis.

Categorizing things can be considered a fundamental, spontaneous act of the human mind, and Q-Cat is a helpful addition to the Q-methodologists toolkit to study it.

komki$items <- komki$items[komki$items$Handle.english %in% rownames(komki$qsorts), ]
komki$qcat$ass <- sapply(X = komki$qcat$ass, simplify = FALSE, FUN = function(x) {
  x[rownames(x) %in% rownames(komki$qsorts), , drop = FALSE]
})

# killing jason, because a) he just didn't REALLY do the thing and b) he dominates the qcat model, which we don't like.
komki$qsorts <- komki$qsorts[, colnames(komki$qsorts) != "Jason"]

```


## Data Gathering: Subjective Categorizing as *Pure Behavior*

In the `Q-Cat` procedure, participants sort items according to their own, "first-person", arbitrary categories.
<!-- TODO add citation for first-person -->
These categories are:

- **operant**, because they arise *spontaneously* as participants engage the items,
- **inductive**, because participants describe their own, *open-ended* categories, which can be neither correct, nor incorrect,
- **ipsatively** assigned, because categories are originally defined as *similarity* between categories.

In contrast to other sorting techniques, which require a *single* set of mutually exclusive, and comprehensively exhaustive ("MECE") categories as a disjoint set vis-a-vis the items [@coxon-1999, p. 3], `Q-Cat` *encourages* overlapping *multiple* categories, each of which is merely *logically* (`TRUE`, `FALSE`) assigned to each item.
This complicates the analysis, but avoids imposing a pre-supposed structure of categorical subjectivity on participants.
^[In a future iteration, participants will ipsatively *rank* items vis-a-vis a categorical *prototype* (chosen from the items, compare @rosch-1978), yielding *ordinal* information, requiring a separate, non-parametric analytical procedure.]

For our example study on categorizations of language games with children and grown-ups, this yields a *list* of description matrices (one element for each participant, as in table \@ref(tab:desc-example)) and a three-dimensional *array* of assignment matrices (one slice for each participant, as in table \@ref(tab:ass-example)).
^[This canonical data representation can be easily produced from conveniently entered raw data with [`pensieveR::import_qcat()`](http://pensiever.maxheld.de).]

```

                 L = "Aussprache",
                 H = "Satzzeichen",
                 G = "Reime")
chosen_cat_indices <- which(x = LETTERS %in% names(chosen_cats))
komki$qcat$desc[names(chosen_cats), "Julius"] <- c("animals", 
                                                   "pronounciation", 
                                                   "punctuation", 
                                                   "rhymes")

chosen_items <- c("language-of-bees", "eating-grandpa")

desc_example <- data.frame(Index = chosen_cat_indices,
                           Description = komki$qcat$desc[names(chosen_cats), "Julius"],
                           row.names = NULL)

ass_example <- komki$qcat$ass$Julius[chosen_items, chosen_cat_indices]
```

```{r desc-example, echo=FALSE}
kable(x = desc_example,
      row.names = FALSE,
      caption = "Description Matrix (Subset)")

```{r ass-example, echo=FALSE}
kable(x = ass_example,
      row.names = TRUE, 
      col.names = as.character(c(1:ncol(ass_example))),
      caption = "Assignment Matrix (Subset)")
```


## Analysis 1: Shared Categories as Surprising Similarity

To analyze `Q-Cat` data, we must first render the individual categorisations comparable.
 ^[Note that the data in canonical form *cannot* be compared between individuals. For example, `Nhome`'s first category is independently defined (by her) from the above `Julius`'s first category, and so on.]
To do that, we first transform the binary assignments into continuous deviations from *probable* assignments.
The probable assignment is the *expected value* $\mathbb{E}$ for some item draw, which is, intuitively, the probability-weighted ($p$) arithmetic average of outcomes $x_1$ (`TRUE`)  and $x_2$ (`FALSE`),

<!-- TODO use pretty math (doesn't work with with tufte-html for now) -->
<!-- <script type="text/x-mathjax-config"> -->
<!-- MathJax.Hub.Config({ -->
<!--   TeX: { equationNumbers: { autoNumber: "AMS" } } -->
<!-- }); -->
<!-- </script> -->
<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!--   \mathbb{E}(X) = x_1 p_1 + x_2 p_2 \label{eq:ev} -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->

$$\mathbb{E}(X) = x_1 p_1 + x_2 p_2$$

where $p_1$ probability of `TRUE` is simply the count of `TRUE`s $z$ divided by the number of items $y$, $p_1 = z / y$, and $p_2 = 1 - p_1$.
We then subtract this *expected value* from the *observed* realization for some $x$, yielding

$$x{'} = x - \mathbb{E}(X).$$



```{r make-surprise, echo=FALSE}
make_surprise <- function(ass) {
  surprise <- ass  # TODO better make this object empty in future!
  for (person in names(ass)) {
    ev <- colSums(ass[[person]]) / nrow(ass[[person]])
    surprise[[person]] <- t(apply(X = ass[[person]], MARGIN = 1, FUN = function(x) {x - ev}))
  }
  return(surprise)
}
surprise <- make_surprise(ass = komki$qcat$ass)
kable(x = surprise$Julius[chosen_items, chosen_cat_indices],
      col.names = as.character(c(1:4)),
      caption = "Assignments as Surprisal Values (Subset)")
```

We can now express `Julius`' above assignments from table \@ref(tab:ass-example) as $x{'}$, an information-theoretical *surprisal value* [@attneave-1959].
^[Our measure is a greatly simplified version of *Burton's $Z$*, which required *conditional* probabilities for item-pair co-occurences, because items are drawn into MECE categories *without* replacement [compare @burton-1972].]
A high positive value, such `Julius`' value for category `1` on `language-of-bees` indicates that this assignment is *positively* surprising, given the probable assignment; it's `TRUE`"ishness" is *higher* than would be expected on average.
The inverse holds for `Julius`' value for category `2` on `eating-grandpa`; it is *less* `TRUE`ish than would be expected, even though only slightly so.

Summary statistics about the surprisal value matrices are also readily interpretable.
For example, `Julius` has a mean surprisal value of `mean(surprise$Julius["language-of-bees", ])` for `language-of-bees`, implying that the item attracted many *more* category assignments than expected.
Conversely, a high standard deviation, such as for `Julius`' `the-same` (`sd(surprise$Julius["the-same", ])`) suggests that the item was assigned much *more* than expected to some categories, but not to others.
Both characteristics of category assignments are appropriately standardized away by the correlation coefficient, because a high center of, or high spread of assignments should not give extra weight to some item.
<!-- TODO this is still a little thin, but also maybe just a footnote -->

Thus standardized for the category *width*, *spread* and *center* we can now easily *correlate* the surprisal value of all item pairs, yielding a three dimensional array of items x items x people.
^[A simpler approach, tried out earlier, would simply *count* the co-occurences of item-pairs in any set of categories, but such a procedure does not standardize for category width, and has the disadvantage of only producing a *co-occurence* matrix.]

This correlation of the *surprisal values* of item pairs, observed over a (varying) number of (open-ended) categories is, oddly, neither an `R`, nor a `Q`-type analysis.
The correlated variables are items, but the observations are *also* "variables" of sorts, namely the inductive categories described by participants.
As will be obvious in the next step, this preliminary summary is necessary to enable a "Q-way" analysis of the categorical data available here: categorisations must *first* be made comparable accross participants, which is what the surprisal value correlation matrices as a rough indication of *categorically* assigned similarity accomplish.

`Julius` slice is display in figure \@ref(fig:make-cora).
The correlation coefficients encompass a surprising range, all the way from `-1` to `1` - even on the off-diagonal.
Strictly speaking, the values *can* be interpreted as categorically assigned, *surprising* similarity.
*Measured by the granularity of the present study* (i.e. the number of observed categories for some participant), an off-diagonal `1` can be taken to indicate *total* similarity.
As with other samples, this measure entails an element of chance: `Julius`' *perfect* correlation between items `resistance` and `comma` likely does *not* indicate that `Julius` thought the two were truly *identical*.
They just *appear* to be identical on the (limited) number categories observed, and would probably be differentiated, had they been observed on more, or different categories.
We can, consequently, have more confidence in a surprisal correlation matrix that is based on a greater number of observation (= categories), because chance "identities" are less likely to arise, though given the intensive nature of the method, the number of observations is likely to always remain quite limited.
When extracting the *shared* patterns of categorical similarity, it will be important to deflate resulting models by the probability of such random, likely false-positive identities through means of a custom parallel analysis or related methods [@Glorfeld-1995, @Horn-1965].

This operation appears, at first glance, similar to Repertory Grid Technique [RGT, e.g. @fransella-2004], where participants also evaluate a *given* set of items (called "elements" in RGT) on some inductive, participant-defined categories (called "constructs" in RGT), though RGT employs *interval* measurements (not categorical) and cannot reveal inter-individual *differences*, because the analysis procceeds R-ways.
The analysis suggested here, works quite differently - observations and variables are, in classic Q fashion, transposed.
Whereas in RGT, open-ended *categories* are correlated over *items* as observations to reveal similarity categories, we - initially - suggest to correelate *items* over categories as observations to reveal similar items, which are, at a later stage, referred back to initially entered categories.

```{r make-cora, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Julius' Item x Item Correlation Matrix as a Heatmap", fig.height=10, fig.width=10}
make_cora <- function(surprise) {
  cora <- sapply(X = surprise, USE.NAMES = TRUE, simplify = "array", FUN = function(x) {
    m <- cor(t(x))
    return(m)
  })
  names(dimnames(cora)) <- c("item", "item", "people")
  return(cora)
}
cora <- make_cora(surprise = surprise)

library(GGally)
ggcorr(data = cora[,,"Julius"], label = TRUE)
```

The correlation heatmap in \@ref(fig:make-cora) is broadly informative, but too big for researchers to make sense of, simply because the item combinations are many - as they should be, for a productive analysis.
Because item surprisal similarity is here expressed as a simple correlation matrix, we can employ a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to reduce its dimensionality.

```{r julius-pca, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Item Loadings on Julius' First Two Quartimax-Rotated Components"}
pca_julius <- prcomp(x = t(surprise$Julius), retx = TRUE, center = TRUE, scale. = TRUE)
# todo add a proper biplot here, does that even make sense?
library(GPArotation)
rotated_julius <- quartimax(L = pca_julius$rotation[,1:7])$loadings

# now let's find the scores, so we know which were the original categories assigned here
scores_julius <- matrix(data = NA,
                        nrow = ncol(rotated_julius),
                        ncol = ncol(surprise$Julius))
for(pc in 1:ncol(rotated_julius)) {
  scored_surprise <- surprise$Julius
  for(item in rownames(rotated_julius)) {
    scored_surprise[item, ] <- surprise$Julius[item, ] * rotated_julius[item, pc]
  }
  scores_julius[pc,] <- colSums(scored_surprise)
}

scores_n_desc <- data.frame(desc = komki$qcat$desc[1:17,"Julius"],
                           scores = t(scores_julius))
# View(scores_n_desc)

#rownames(rotated_julius) <- komki$items$Handle.deutsch  # comment me out unless you want german items
ggplot(data = as.data.frame(rotated_julius[,1:2]), mapping = aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, label = rownames(rotated_julius))) + geom_text(position = position_jitter(width = 0.05))
```

Figure \@ref(fig:julius-pca) displays the item loadings in the first two rotated principal components (out of seven with an Eigenvalue greater than one).
These loadings can be interpreted as similarity of items in terms of their surprising category assignment; `i-we` and `but-how` *both* are surprisingly *present* on the first dimension of such similarity, while `riddle` and `idiom` are both surprisingly *absent* on the same dimension.
Using factor *scores*, which are here ideal-typical category *assignments*, we can also relate this summary back to the original descriptions.
A cursory inspection of the item pattern and the underlying descriptions suggests that `Julius` first rotated reflects his formal categorisations (such as punctuation), as opposed to his more substantive judgments (such as whether an item was a joke, or played with the meaning of words).
Such *individual* level summary illustrates the logic and *should* be meaningful, in principle, though it is likely to be of limited use in real research because the underlying observations are so sparse, and uncorrected surprisal values accordingly unreliable for an individual.
^[A proper analysis of individual level categorisations will also benefit from more specialized visualizations and may require custom rotation methods.]


## Analysis 2: Ideal Types of Ideal Types

We now have an array $\underline{X}$ of order

$$J \times J \times K$$

or, in this context,

$$Items \times Items \times People$$,

where cells cells are Pearson's correlation coefficients, each across some observations of some item pair.
(See [this related answer](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/230479/how-to-reduce-the-dimensionality-of-a-similarity-matrix-of-categorical-co-occur/231333#231333) on why this correlation matrix is the only comparable data we have; we can't go back to raw*er* data.)

Since *both* the number of people *and* the number of item-pairs are too large to make sense of the data, we need to reduce the dimensionality.
Specifically, we want to reduce the people to *fewer* ideal types, and then describe these ideal type's *ideal types* of co-occuring items, potentially yielding of shared, categorical subjectivities of participants.

Since we are looking for a simple dimensionality reduction (not a causal or latent variable model), the n-mode generalisations of PCA, Candecomp/Parafac [PC, @carrol-chang-1970 and independently @harshman-1970] and the more involved Tucker procedures [@tucker-1966] apply here.

## Open issues

- rotation?
- pre-proccessing (centering, scaling)
- post-processing (normalizing)
- robustness and Bayesian critique (parallel analysis)


## Interpretation

While different in procedure and data type, `Q-Cat` shares the paradigmatic foundations of Q methodology.
