Good, evocative items lie at the heart of a Q study.
In fact, akin to the old computer science adage of  *"garbage-in / garbage-out"*, the quality of the *items* strictly limits the insights that may be gleaned from the entire study.

Generating and selecting good items is at least half science, half tradecraft.
There are some standards and frameworks that can structure your item generation and sampling, but -- for now at least -- it still requires a lot of experience, intuition and knowledge of the domain in question.

`pensieve` supports this stage of a Q study in a number of ways:

1. Items **generation and selection** can be fully documented inside of `pensieve`, making the process transparent, reproducible and easy to iterate over.
2. Items can be **professionally typeset**, and stored in `pensieve`, so that participants and researchers alike both see the items in the *same, definitive form*, be they text or images.
3. Arbitrary **additional information** can be stored alongside the items for later "R-way" analysis.

Items and related information are stored in a specific, domain-specific format in `pensieve`, a list of S3 class `psItems`.
You can use the package entirely without `psItems`, though providing additional information about the items is highly recommended.
For example, providing the full item text (or image) enhances some of the downstream plots.

As always, the `psItems` list *can* be quite extensive, covering a lot of use cases.
But there is no need to worry, if your study is simpler: 
only a few elements are necessary (in bold), and even the entire `psItems` is optional.

- `psItems`
  -  **`psItemConcourse`** for the full item stimulus, either as
    *`psItemConcourseText`* or
    *`psItemConcourseImage`*.
  - `psItemStrata` for structured sampling.
