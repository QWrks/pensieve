#' Open sorting categorizations *cannot* be compared between participants, because each participants defines her own categories.
#' **The canonical representation of open sorting data** is therefore a *list* of matrices, one for each participant.
#' Every *individual* matrix is a [psOpenSort()] object, and together, they form a [psOpenSorts()] list.
#' The rows in these matrices are the items, the columns are the category, and cells are the assignment.

#' Notice that -- counterintuitively -- *categorically*-scaled open sorts are not allowed.
#' If columns are named, they must be the same as the names in `descriptions`.
#' Either way, `assignments` and `descriptions` are always *matched by index only*: the first column from `assignments`, must be the first element of `description`, and so forth.

#' @describeIn psOpenSorts Create bipartite plot from *individual* open sort.

#' @param object a [psOpenSort], created by [psOpenSort()].
#'
#' @param edge_codings a tibble with category description indeces in the first column, and arbitrary metadata *about the descriptions* in limited later columns:
#' - 2nd column will be mapped to line color,
#' - 3rd column will be mapped to line type (and must be discrete).
#' Later columns will be ignored.
#' Useful if participants or researchers have coded the open-ended descriptions in some way.
#' Category description indeces must be a subset of the column names in `x`.
#' If more then one code applies to a category, multiple rows with identical categories can exist, and multiple, "fanned-out" edges will be drawn between the respective nodes.
#' See note.
#' Defaults to `NULL`.
#'
#' @param str_wrap_width integer scalar, giving the maximum number of characters after which to insert a newline, passed on to [stringr::str_wrap()].
#' Defaults to `30`.
#' Useful for long descriptions.
#'
#' @note
#' To render the resulting `ggplot` object, you must *manually* call `library(ggraph)` somewhere in your script (as per [this limitation](https://github.com/thomasp85/ggraph/issues/85)).
#'
#' If `codings` are added, the aesthetics are set *for each individual [psOpenSort] separately*, which may make it hard to compare plots across participants.
#' To get consistent code aesthetics, consider applying [ggraph::scale_edge_color_manual()] and friends.

#' Assignments must be the same subset of `LETTERS` as the column names in `descriptions_messy`.
#' Rows and columns must be named.

#'
#' @param descriptions_messy a character matrix with rows as category indices, columns as participants and **category descriptions** in cells.

#' Columns *must* be named as participants.

#'
#' Notice category description in one row have *nothing in common* other than their *indices*:
#' For example, the category descriptions in a row named `'B'` are all by different participants, and may refer to entirely different aspects.
#' They are only conveniently entered in a table, and all share the fact that they were the *second* description provided.
#'
#' When some category has not been defined by the participant, the value in the cell should be `NA`.

#' The canonical representation of open sorts in [psOpenSorts()] can be cumbersome to enter manually.
