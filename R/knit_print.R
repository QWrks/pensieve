#' Roxygen templates did not work so well, because calling them would include *all* arguments, and not just the ones actually used
#'
#' @param inline
#' `[logical(1)]` indicating whether knitr is called from *inline* (`r 1+1`) or from a chunk.
#' Defaults to `FALSE`.
#' @param use_js
#' `[logical(1)]`, indicating whether an interactive, java-script variant of the printed result should be returned.
#' Applicable only to HTML-outputs.
