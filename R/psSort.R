# these should be subclasses to the more general psSort, and only differentiate in the methods as far as necessary
# the documentation below is as far as possible already generic, but this needs refactoring.

# helper ====
#' @title Store an *individual* sort as a character matrix of *item handles*
#' @description
#' Stores *one* sort, by one participant as an \eqn{i * k} character matrix, with sorting columns as columns, sorting rows as rows and *short item handles* (see `psItems`) in cells.
#'
#' @details
#' Sorts can be stored in the form in which they were originally created on a table or in a computer user interface.
#' The `y`-axis, though meaningless (ties) in most studies, is also stored, but this full matrix form makes it easy to reason about the data, and to validate it.
#'
# this argument is almost the same as grid for psGrid; some duplication
#' @param sort `[matrix()]`
#' giving the occupying item of cells as `character(1)` strings of **item handles**.
#' `NA` is used for empty *and* disallowed cells (see [psGrid][psGrid]).
#' At least one dimension should be named (see examples), or the x-axis (column names) is assumed to be the sorting direction.
#' Unnamed dimensions are assumed to be meaningless, i.e. used for stacking tied items.
#'
#' @param desc_x,desc_y `[character(1)]`
#' giving a description of the sorting dimensions, such as the condition of instruction.
#' Defaults to `NULL`.
#' `desc_x` is for horizontal sorting across the columns.
#' `desc_y` is for (rarely used) vertical sorting across the rows.
#'
#' @inheritParams psGrid
#' @inheritSection psGrid Hexagonal tiling
#' @family S3 classes from `pensieve`.
#' @return A character matrix of class [psSort][psSort].
