# TODO actually this individual form would work for psOpenSort AND psClosedSort as well!
# these should be subclasses to the more general psSort, and only differentiate in the methods as far as necessary
# the documentation below is as far as possible already generic, but this needs refactoring.

#' @title Store an *individual*  sort (Q-sort) as a character matrix.
#' @description
#' Stores *one* sort, by one participant as a character \eqn{i * k} matrix, with sorting columns as columns, sorting rows as rows and *short item handles* (see `psItems`) in cells.
#'
#' @details
#' Sorts can be stored in the form in which they were originally created on a table or in a computer user interface.
#' The `y`-axis, though meaningless (ties) in most studies, is also stored, but this full matrix form makes it easy to reason about the data, and to validate it.
#'
#' Storing sorts of *several* participants as *lists* of such `psSort`s (as is done in `psData`) also makes it possible to record sorts where not all participants used exactly the same sorting template (different `psGrid`s or tesselation patterns).
#'
# TODO link to these methods, and find precise VERBS for these transformations.
#' Methods are included to rbind `psItems` to `psData`, as well as to transform them into a tidy matrix.
#'
#' @param sort
#' A character matrix giving the item positions of the sort.
#' Items must be identified by their item short handles and must be unique.
#' If `grid` is specified, only `TRUE` cells can have items.
#'
#' @inheritParams psGrid
#'
#' @family S3 classes from `pensieve`.
#'
#' @return A character matrix of class [psSort][psSort].
