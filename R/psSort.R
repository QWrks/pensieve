#' @title Store an *individual* sort as a character matrix of *item handles*
#' @description
#' Stores *one* sort, by one participant as an \eqn{i * k} character matrix, with sorting columns as columns, sorting rows as rows and *short item handles* (see `psItems`) in cells.
#'
#' @details
#' Sorts can be stored in the form in which they were originally created on a table or in a computer user interface.
#' The `y`-axis, though meaningless (ties) in most studies, is also stored, but this full matrix form makes it easy to reason about the data, and to validate it.
#'
# this argument is almost the same as sort for psSort; some duplication
#' @param sort `[matrix()]`
#' giving the occupying item of cells for sorting as `character(1)` strings of **item handles**.
#' `NA` is used for empty *and* disallowed cells (see [psGrid][psGrid]).
#' The (horizontal) x-axis is assumed to be the sorting direction, the (vertical) y-axis for recording ties.
#' Dimensions can be named (recommended), giving a short description of the sorting dimension (only applicable to the x-axis).
#' Row and column *indeces* can also be named, but names are purely cosmetic.
