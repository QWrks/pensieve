# plural; list of multiple open sort matrices ====

#' @title Store open sorts in a psOpenSort list.
#'
#' @details
#' Open sorting categorizations *cannot* be compared between participants, because each participants defines her own dimensions.
#'
#' **The canonical representation of open sorting data** is therefore a *list* of matrices, one for each participant.
#' Every *individual* matrix is a [psOpenSort()] object, and together, they form a [psOpenSorts()] list.
#' The rows in these matrices are the items, the columns are the dimensions, and cells are the assignment.
#' Optional dimension descriptions are included as attributes of the matrices.
#'
#' @param open_sorts
#' A list of matrices, one for each participant.
#' Matrices must be [psOpenSort()] objects.
#'
#' @example tests/testthat/helper_psOpenSorts.R
#'
#' @return Object of class `psOpenSorts`.

# import helper

#' @describeIn psOpenSorts descriptions and *logical* assignments from convenient, but messy format
#'
#' @export
#'
#' @param assignments_messy a character matrix with rows as items, columns as participants and  **logical category assignments** as character strings in cells.
#' Categories are identified by a subset from `LETTERS`, same as in `descriptions_messy`.
#' Assignments must be the same subset of `LETTERS` as the column names in `descriptions_messy`.
#' Rows and columns must be named.
#'
#' For example, if some participant assigned her (self-described) categories `A`, `D` and `Z` to some item, the cell for that item and participant would read `"A, D, Z"`.
#' Order and punctuation are ignored.
#'
#' See `note`.
#'
#' @param descriptions_messy a character matrix with rows as category indices, columns as participants and **category descriptions** in cells.
#' Rows *must* be named by a subset of `LETTERS` to conveniently enter, and identify them from `assignments_messy`.
#' The row names are arbitrary identifiers, but will be retained for the canonical form.
#' Columns *must* be named as participants.
#'
#' Defaults to `NULL`, in which case no descriptions are available.
#'
#' Notice category description in one row have *nothing in common* other than their *indices*:
#' For example, the category descriptions in a row named `'B'` are all by different participants, and may refer to entirely different aspects.
#' They are only conveniently entered in a table, and all share the fact that they were the *second* description provided.
#'
#' When some category has not been defined by the participant, the value in the cell should be `NA`.
#' Empty strings `""` will also be considered `NA`.
#'
#' @param keep_LETTERS a logical flag.
#' Defaults to `TRUE`, in which case the `LETTERS` for the category descriptions and assignments are retained as names, even though they are just indices and not actual meaningful names (useful for debugging).
#'
#' @details
#' The canonical representation of open sorts in [psOpenSorts()] can be cumbersome to enter manually.
#' For *logical* (nominally-scaled) open sorts, a simpler, but messier format can be conveniently entered as two separate spreadsheets of `descriptions_messy` and `assignments_messy` using [import_psOpenSorts()].
#'
#' @note
#' When a category is assigned, but never described, it is `TRUE` in the respective logical matrix entries and their description is `NA`:
#' This is still considered valuable, if incomplete information.
#' When a category is described, but never assigned, it is omitted from the data entirely.
#'
#' When *no* category was assigned to some item in `assignments_messy`, an empty character string `""` should be in the respective cell.
#'
#' An `NA` value implies that the given participant never considered the given items *at all*, across *all* her categories.
#' Notice this implies *limited scenarios of `NA`* for data entered in this messy, convenient form.
#' The more complicated cases, where a participant did consider *some*, but *not all* items in the assignment of a category, or -- equivalently -- all categories in their assessment of all items, cannot be recorded in this convenience format.
#' Such more granular `NA` records can, however, be recorded in the canonical data representation, where the respective cell of the items x category logical matrix would be `NA`.
#' If your data gathering procedure produces such granular `NA` records, do not use this convenience function.

#' a matrix with items as rows, open dimensions as columns, and open sort value in cells.
#' Matrix must be either
#' - `logical` for *nominal*-scaled sort, where an open dimension applies (`TRUE`) or does not apply (`FALSE`),

#'
#' If rows are named (by item handles), names must be valid R names.
#'
#' If columns are named, they must be valid R names and they must be the same as the names in `descriptions`.

#' @description Creates co-occurence matrices from logical q-category assignments.
#'
#' @param ass Named list of logical matrices, one for each participant.
#' Each logical matrix has items as named rows, category indices as columns and logical values in cells.
#'
#' @return
#' An integer array with items as rows and columns, participants as third dimension and cells as co-occurence counts.
#'
#' @details
#' The diagonal is replaced with the *maximum number of categories* for that person, to standardize the entire table.
