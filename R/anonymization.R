#' @description Create random names and/or replace real names with random names to anonymize data.
#'
#' @param real_names A vector with unique names.
#' If there are no known real names, provide vector of unique integers instead.
#'
#' @param lookup_file A character vector of length one as the file to write the lookup table to, or read the lookup table from.
#' See **details** for more, **notes** for caveats.
#' File should not be published to preserve the identity of participants.

#' @details
#' It is sometimes helpful in Q analyses to be able to refer to people-variables by a unique name, though real names often cannot be used in publications to protect participant's data.
#'
#' This function looks up `real_names` in the `lookup_file` and returns the respective fake names.
#'
#' The `lookup_file` must always be a `*.csv`-file with two columns of character vectors, named `real_names` and `fake_names`.
#'
#' If the specified `lookup_file` does not exist, new random `fake_names` are sampled from `randomNames`, and written to disc as the specified file.
#' Generated `fake_names` are unique and can be used as R variable names.
#'
#' If the `lookup_file` does not include all `real_names`, it is likewise appended with new `fake_names`.
#' All entries must be unique and valid R variable names.
#' The rows in the `lookup_file` can be in an arbitrary order, and can also include entries that are never used.
#'
#' By providing a `lookup_file` users (or participants) can choose their own `fake_names`, though this may not protect personal data well.
#' In particular, storing socio-demographic data of participants as custom `fake_names` (such as, for example `"m_us_31"`) is not advised, because such data may be easily breached and downstream functions expect socio-demographic data in a different format.
#'
#' @note
#' **Despite its name, this function *does not magically anonymize data*, but merely replaces names with randomly drawn fake names.
#' It is your responsibility to protect your participants' data.
#' If you are unsure, or do not understand the below caveats, *do not rely on this function*.**
#'
#' 1. The lookup table with real and fake names must be stored in a safe place, ideally *encrypted* and *not together with the raw data or results*.
#' 2. Your data may still be deanonymized if it includes other personal information and/or few participants.
#' 3. Make sure no `real names` are included in your command history, caches or other R objects and scripts.
#'
#' @return
#' A character vector of fake names, same length as `real_names`.
#' Also writes a lookup table to disk at location `lookup_file`, if it does not exist already.
