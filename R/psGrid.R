#' @title Store sorting grid as logical matrix.
#'
#' @description
#' Stores sorting grid as a logical \eqn{i * k} matrix with sorting columns as columns, sorting rows as rows and `TRUE` (allowed) or `FALSE` (not allowed) in cells.
#'
#' @details
#' *Every* sort must have a grid.
#' Even a free distribution must have a grid, giving the maximum indices of rows and columns, but with all cells `TRUE`.
#'
#' @param grid
#' A logical matrix giving the available cells for Q sorting.
#' Accepts arbitrary dimnames from grid.
#' If any dimnames are missing, sensible defaults will be set.
#'
#' @param pattern
#' A character string, giving the pattern of tesselation to use.
#' Must be `"chessboard"` (default), the only currently supported pattern.
#'
#' @param offset
#' A character string, giving the rows to be offset.
#' Must be `"even"`, `"odd"` or `NULL` (default).
#' Applies only to `"honeycomb"` and `"brickwall"` patterns, otherwise ignored.
#'
#' @example tests/testthat/helper_psGrid.R
#'
#' @family S3 classes from `pensieve`
#'
#' @return A logical matrix of class [psGrid][psGrid].

#' @export
# TODO it's not clear that we even need "honeycomb" or "brickwall"; perhaps *both* are saved as axial coordinates, and only the shape is slightly different https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#coordinates, proper term would be hexagonal binning
# TODO is it really brickwall tesselation? what is the real term for this?
# TODO in case of hex coord system, you might also need pointy top or flat top as a variable
