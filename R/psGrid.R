#' @title Store sorting grid as logical matrix.
#'
#' @description
#' Stores sorting grid as a logical \eqn{i * k} matrix with sorting columns as columns, sorting rows as rows and `TRUE` (allowed) or `FALSE` (not allowed) in cells.
#'
#' @details
#' *Every* sort must have a grid.
#' Even a free distribution must have a grid, giving the maximum indices of rows and columns, but with all cells `TRUE`.
#'
# this argument is almost the same as sort for psSort; some duplication
#' @param grid `[matrix()]`
#' giving the availability of cells for sorting as `logical(1)` values.
#' At least one dimension should be named (see examples), or the x-axis (column names) is assumed to be the sorting direction.
#' Unnamed dimensions are assumed to be meaningless, i.e. used for stacking tied items.

#'
#' @section Hexagonal tiling:
#' [psGrid][psGrid] and [psSort][psSort] store *all* sorting grids as *rectangular* matrices, using what is known as the ["offset" notation for hexagonal tiling](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/).
#' In offset notation, hexagonal tilings are saved as if they were normal (square) tilings, with an additional attribute giving which rows are to be offset.
#' In this way, both square and hexagonal tilings can be stored in a similar format.
#' They are also intuitive to use, where the outer limits of the tiling are rectangular, and rotation is not required, both of which are usually the case for sorting.
#' However, linear algebra operations are no longer defined on such hexagonal matrices in offset notation (that would require cube or axial coordinates).
#' Remember not to run such operations on hexagonally tiled [psGrid][psGrid]s or [psSort][psSort]s.
# TODO if we ever need "proper" cube/axial coordinates, say for a real honeycomb structure, this should be implemented as a subclass to `psGrid`, with appropriate coercion methods. Seems overkill for now.
#'
#' The `offset` argument is used to switch between loosely defined tiling patterns.
#' Strictly speaking there are  *three regular* tiling patterns: square, hexagonal and triangular.
#' However, items are more easily typeset in *rectangles* than in squares, hexagons or triangles.
#' You can therefore also use "square" tiling (`offset = NULL`) for rectangulary set items, and even "hexagonal" tiling (`offset = "even"` or `offset = "odd"`) for rectangles (in a "brickwall" pattern) and irregular (stretched or squeezed) hexagons.
#' One combination remains impossible: you cannot have "square" tiling (`offset = NULL`) with hexagons (`polygon = 'hexagon'`).
#'
#' The aspect ratio of the *irregular* polygons is currently only provided to respective `knit_print()` methods.
#' To achieve *regular* square and hexagonal tiling (though this is unlikely to be useful), set `aspect_ratio_cards` to `1`.
#'
#' Notice that `offset` always refers to *rows*, and as such implies hexagonal tiling in "**pointy**"-topped rotation.
# TODO in the astronomically unlikely case of flat topped hex grids, this would need to be another variable; offset would then refer to *columns*
#'
#' Remember that rows for `offset` are given using *R* indices, starting with `1`.
#' Examples of offset notation in most other programming languages will differ."
