#' @details
#' It is sometimes helpful in Q analyses to be able to refer to people-variables by a unique name, though real names often cannot be used in publications to protect participant's data.
#'
#' This function looks up \code{real_names} in the \code{lookup_file} and returns the respective fake names.
#'
#' The \code{lookup_file} must always be a \code{*.csv}-file with two columns of character vectors, named `real_names` and `fake_names`.
#'
#' If the specified \code{lookup_file} does not exist, new random `fake_names` are sampled from \pkg{randomNames}, and written to disc as the specified file.
#' Generated `fake_names` are unique and can be used as R variable names.
#'
#' If the \code{lookup_file} does not include all \code{real_names}, it is likewise appended with new `fake_names`.
#' All entries must be unique and valid R variable names.
#' The rows in the \code{lookup_file} can be in an arbitrary order, and can also include entries that are never used.
#'
#' By providing a \code{lookup_file} users (or participants) can choose their own `fake_names`, though this may not protect personal data well.
#' In particular, storing socio-demographic data of participants as custom `fake_names` (such as, for example \code{"m_us_31"}) is not advised, because such data may be easily breached and downstream functions expect socio-demographic data in a different format.
#'
#' @note
#' \strong{
#'   Despite its name, this function \emph{does not magically anonymize data}, but merely replaces names with randomly drawn fake names.
#'   It is your responsibility to protect your participants' data.
#'   If you are unsure, or do not understand the below caveats, \emph{do not rely on this function}.
#'   \enumerate{
#'     \item The lookup table with real and fake names must be stored in a safe place, ideally \emph{encrypted} and \emph{not together with the raw data or results}.
#'     \item Your data may still be deanonymized if it includes other personal information and/or few participants.
#'     \item Make sure no `real names` are included in your command history, caches or other R objects and scripts.
#'   }
#' }
#'
#' @return
#' A character vector of fake names, same length as \code{real_names}.
#' Also writes a lookup table to disk at location \code{lookup_file}, if it does not exist already.
