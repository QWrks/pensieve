#' @description Draw one random Q-sort dataset, parametrized as original data.
#'
#' @param grid
#' A positive integer vector of a length covering the range of values, specifying maximum allowed frequencies for each value.
#' (in Q-parlance, the maximum column heights for the Q-sorts).
#'
#' @param n A positive integer vector of length 1, as the number of people-variables.
#' Defaults to `NULL`, in which case parameter is inferred from `data`.
#'
#' @param p A positive integer vector of length 1, as the number of item-cases.
#' Defaults to `NULL`, in which case parameter is inferred from `data`.
#'
#' @keywords internal
#'
#' @details
#' This function draws a *random* dataset, parametrized as some real or hypothetical *observed* dataset from a Q study.
#'
#' Q data has some peculiarities that must be implemented to draw comparable random datasets, and that are not addressed in existing packages implementing parallel analysis (such as [paran::paran()]):
#'
#' - **Integers.**
#'   The simulated data include only integers.
#' - **Draws without replacement.**
#'   Because two items cannot occupy the same position in a Q-sort, random data must be drawn *without replacement* from the grid of available item positions (slots).
#' - **Forced or free distribution.**
#'   Depending on whether the observed data resulted from a forced or free distribution, random data must be drawn from the appropriate available item positions (slots).
#'
#' Helper function for [run_parallel()].
#'
#' @note
#' Notice that in the case of a free distribution, there are *no* assumptions on the distributional shape (such as uni-modal, bimodal etc.).
#' Random data for a free distribution are therefore drawn from an (on average over all people-variables) *rectangular* distribution *over all available slots*, as a *neutral* distributional shape.
#' A more sophisticated parallel analysis may first infer some observed distribution parameters and then draw random data accordingly as per [issue 146 on the development repo](https://github.com/maxheld83/pensieve/issues/146).
#'
#' @return
#' A random integer matrix with item-cases as rows and people-variables as columns.

#'
#' @param dataset
#' An integer matrix with item-cases as rows and people-variables as columns.
#' Defaults to `NULL`, in which case parameters must be passed to `draw_rand_sort()` using `...`.
#'
#' @param centile
#' A positive numerical vector of length 1, as the percentile of random eigenvalues to return.
#' Defaults to the conventional significance threshold of `.95`.
#'
#' @param runs
#' A positive integer vector of length 1, as the number of random data to draw, defaults to `5000`.
#' Lower number will reduce computational cost, but results may be less reliable.
#'
#' @param cutoff
#' A positive integer vector of length 1, as the maximum number of Principal Components to extract from random data.
#' Defaults to `NULL`, in which case the minimum of `n` and `p` are used, because there can be no more Principal Components than there are item-cases `or` people-variables in a dataset.
#' Manually specifying a lower number may reduce the computational cost.

#'
#' @details
#' Implements Horn's (1965) parallel analysis as a guide to inform factor retention, with appropriate parametrization for Q-sort data (via [draw_rand_sort()]).
#'
#' Random data can include spurious correlations and spurious factors by mere chance.
#' This problem might affect Q studies, too: people might produce similar Q sorts not because they share viewpoints, but just out of random chance.
#' Parallel analysis tests this assertion by extracting (spurious) principal components from many sets of random data, similarly parametrized as the provided `data`.
#'
#' The analysis returns the random eigenvalues at the specified `centile` over all of the specified random `runs`.
#' This result can be interpreted as a necessary Eigenvalue threshold for some *observed* principal component to be considered non-spurious, with the specified centile as the confidence (or significance level).
#'
#' In summary, parallel analysis suggests the number of factors in the data that are unlikely to be products of random chance at some significance level `centile`.
#'
#' For more details, consider the related [paran::paran].

#' This function is currently based on principal components analysis (PCA) as a ``factor'' extraction technique.
#' Thompson (2004: 30ff) and others seem to suggest that such PCA-based criteria can be used as rough indications for how many factors to extract with other exploratory techniques.
#' However, some of the results presented here are meaningful *only* in a PCA-context, and dependent functions are sometimes called with PCA-related options.
