# this should be a simple named list of vectors, each vector element being a column name in psItemVars, and a list name being a stratification dimension
# a "stratify" function can then build a convenient list of matrices giving the interactions of these dimensions
# users can then check, whether they have enough items in all the cells
# or even sample from the cells
