\title{HTML widget factory for sorting grids.}
\usage{
inanimatus(grid = as_psGrid(obj = c(1, 2, 3, 5, 3, 2, 1)),
  sort = matrix(data = c(NA, NA, NA, NA, "foo", NA, NA, NA, "zap", "bar",
  NA, NA, "hup", "op", "schwupp", "rip", "zonk", "oupsi", "what", "omg",
  NA, NA, "zor", "arr", "apple", NA, NA, NA, "warp", "glips", NA, NA, NA,
  NA, "ronk"), ncol = 7), header = TRUE, footer = TRUE,
  aspect_ratio_cards = 16/9, width = NULL, height = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{grid}{\code{[matrix(logical())]}
giving the available cells for sorting.
Accepts arbitrary dimnames from grid.
If any dimnames are missing, sensible defaults will be set.}

\item{sort}{A character matrix giving the item positions of the sort.
Items must be identified by their item short handles and must be unique.
If \code{grid} is specified (recommended), only \code{TRUE} cells can have items.
If \code{items} is specified (recommended), only handles from \code{items} can be used.}

\item{header}{A logical flag, defaults to \code{TRUE}, in which case column names  from \code{grid} are included as headers.}

\item{footer}{A logical flag, defaults to \code{TRUE}, in which case column names  from \code{grid} are included as footers.}

\item{aspect_ratio_cards}{A numeric scalar, giving width divided by height of \emph{individual cards} (such as 16/9 for screen dimensions).
Aspect ratio of \emph{cards} is required to appropriately set the resulting dimensions of the \emph{grid}.
Defaults to standard business cards.}

\item{width}{Fixed width for widget (in css units). The default is
\code{NULL}, which results in intelligent automatic sizing based on the
widget's container.}

\item{height}{Fixed height for widget (in css units). The default is
\code{NULL}, which results in intelligent automatic sizing based on the
widget's container.}
}
\value{
An htmlwidget.
