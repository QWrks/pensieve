\arguments{
\item{grid}{\code{[matrix()]}
giving the availability of cells for sorting as \code{logical(1)} values.
The (horizontal) x-axis is assumed to be the sorting direction, the (vertical) y-axis for recording ties.
Dimensions can be named (recommended), giving a short description of the sorting dimension (only applicable to the x-axis).
Row and column \emph{indeces} can also be named, but names are purely cosmetic.}

\item{sort}{\code{[matrix()]}
giving the occupying item of cells for sorting as \code{character(1)} strings of \strong{item handles}.
\code{NA} is used for empty \emph{and} disallowed cells (see \link{psGrid}).
The (horizontal) x-axis is assumed to be the sorting direction, the (vertical) y-axis for recording ties.
Dimensions can be named (recommended), giving a short description of the sorting dimension (only applicable to the x-axis).
Row and column \emph{indeces} can also be named, but names are purely cosmetic.}

\item{header}{A logical flag, defaults to \code{TRUE}, in which case column or row names from \code{grid} are included as headers or footers, respectively.
Missing row or column names are replaced with sensible defaults.}

\item{footer}{A logical flag, defaults to \code{TRUE}, in which case column or row names from \code{grid} are included as headers or footers, respectively.
Missing row or column names are replaced with sensible defaults.}

\item{aspect_ratio_cards}{A numeric scalar, giving width divided by height of \emph{individual cards} (such as 16/9 for screen dimensions).
Aspect ratio of \emph{cards} is required to appropriately set the resulting dimensions of the \emph{grid}.
Defaults to standard business cards.}

\item{scale_2_height}{\code{[logical()]}
giving whether widget should, in addition to width, \emph{also} be scaled to an ancestor height.
Only set \code{TRUE} if you are sure that the surrounding markup passes down a valid css height property, otherwise you will get bad css for the widget.
Defaults to \code{NULL}; \code{FALSE} when rendering via knitr, otherwise \code{TRUE}.}

\item{width}{Fixed width for widget (in css units). The default is
\code{NULL}, which results in intelligent automatic sizing based on the
widget's container.}

\item{height}{Fixed height for widget (in css units). The default is
\code{NULL}, which results in intelligent automatic sizing based on the
widget's container.}

\value{
An htmlwidget.

\description{
Creates HTML widgets from sorting grids.
Wraps pensieve's inanimatus.js.
End users should use the convenient print method wrappers.
