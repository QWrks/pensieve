  NA, NA, "hup", "op", "schwupp", "rip", "zonk", "oupsi", "what", "omg",

}
\arguments{
\item{grid}{\code{[matrix()]}
giving the availability of cells for sorting as \code{logical(1)} values.
The (horizontal) x-axis is assumed to be the sorting direction, the (vertical) y-axis for recording ties.
Dimensions can be named (recommended), giving a short description of the sorting dimension (only applicable to the x-axis).
Row and column \emph{indeces} can also be named, but names are purely cosmetic.}

\item{sort}{\code{[matrix()]}
giving the occupying item of cells as \code{character(1)} strings of \strong{item handles}.
\code{NA} is used for empty \emph{and} disallowed cells (see \link{psGrid}).
At least one dimension should be named (see examples), or the x-axis (column names) is assumed to be the sorting direction.
Unnamed dimensions are assumed to be meaningless, i.e. used for stacking tied items.}

\item{header}{A logical flag, defaults to \code{TRUE}, in which case column or row names from \code{grid} are included as headers or footers, respectively.
Missing row or column names are replaced with sensible defaults.}

\item{footer}{A logical flag, defaults to \code{TRUE}, in which case column or row names from \code{grid} are included as headers or footers, respectively.
Missing row or column names are replaced with sensible defaults.}

\item{aspect_ratio_cards}{A numeric scalar, giving width divided by height of \emph{individual cards} (such as 16/9 for screen dimensions).
Aspect ratio of \emph{cards} is required to appropriately set the resulting dimensions of the \emph{grid}.
Defaults to standard business cards.}

\item{width}{Fixed width for widget (in css units). The default is
\code{NULL}, which results in intelligent automatic sizing based on the
widget's container.}

\item{height}{Fixed height for widget (in css units). The default is
\code{NULL}, which results in intelligent automatic sizing based on the
widget's container.}
}
\value{
An htmlwidget.
}
\description{
Creates HTML widgets from sorting grids.
Wraps pensieve's inanimatus.js.
End users should use the convenient print method wrappers.
