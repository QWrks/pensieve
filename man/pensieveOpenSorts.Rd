\title{Construct \emph{single} and \emph{multiple} open sort matrix.}
\usage{
pensieveOpenSort(assignments, descriptions = NULL)

pensieveOpenSorts(open_sorts)
}
\arguments{
\item{assignments}{a matrix with item-handles as row names, arbitrary or empty column names, and open sort value in cells.
Matrix must be either
\itemize{
\item \code{logical} for \emph{nominal}-scaled sort, where an open category applies or does not apply,
\item \code{integer} for \emph{ordinally}-scaled sort, where an open category applies to some item \emph{more or less} than to another other item,
\item \code{numeric} for \emph{interval} or \emph{ratio}-scaled sort, where an open category applies to some item \emph{by some amount more or less} than to another item.
Notice that -- counterintuitively -- \emph{categorically}-scaled open sorts are not allowed.
If columns are named, they must be the same as the names in \code{descriptions}.
Either way, \code{assignments} and \code{descriptions} are always \emph{matched by index only}.
}}

\item{descriptions}{a character vector giving the open-ended category description provided by the participant.
Can be named.
Defaults to \code{NULL}, in which case the user-defined categories are unknown (not recommended).}

\item{open_sorts}{named list of matrices created by \code{\link[=pensieveOpenSort]{pensieveOpenSort()}}, one for each participant.
Must all be of equal data type and all have the same rows and rownames.}
}
\description{
Constructs S3 class for pensieve.

\itemize{

\item \code{pensieveOpenSorts}: \emph{Combine} individual open sorts in a list.
