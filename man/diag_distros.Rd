\title{Count distribution of same values per people-variable.}
\usage{
diag_distros(sorts)
}
\arguments{
\item{sorts}{An integer array with item handles as first dimension, people as second dimension, arbitrary dimensions thereafter, and item positions in cells.
Dimensions must be named.}
}
\value{
An integer matrix with people-variables as rows, values as columns and counts in cells.
}
\description{
Counts the number of times an item-case is assigned to each value, yields Q distribution for each people-variable.
}
\examples{
diag_distros(sorts = civicon_2014$qData$sorts[,,"before"])
# results are all the same, because study used forced Q distribution
